                <p class="text-format">CMJD was fully designed for UNDERGRADUATE students who are studying in Government
                    and
                    Private Universities to enhance the knowledge and skills of software developments to the industry
                    standards
                    and also giving marvellous software development training enabling modern software design and
                    developing
                    methodologies (architectural designs and using depth of object orientation) to fill the gap between
                    students
                    and current IT job requirements.</p>
                <p>Even though plenty of theory subjects have been studied in the universities, students are not able to
                    match their primary qualification to get into the IT industry, therefore IJSE introduced this
                    program for the students to fulfill their expectation. According to the past statistics of IJSE,
                    more than 4500 undergraduate students have been produced to IT Industry Island wide.</p>
